                    <title>AI sports betting platforms&apos; breaches likely impacting March Madness wagers</title>
                    
                    <description>AI technology is certainly not immune from the growing negative impacts of cyberattacks, especially has the hacks continue to evolved in frequency and complexity.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;College basketball fans from across the country spent the past couple of weeks keeping a close eye on the NCAA Division I men&apos;s and women&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;basketball tournament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt;. Millions of sports enthusiasts filled out and submitted brackets with hopes their particular games&apos; predictions would become true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual basketball tournament seemingly always sparks a noticeable amount of excitement across the sports world, but it also attracts the casual fan and those who might not normally participate in sports gambling. Several teams will typically compete simultaneously at different arenas across the U.S. and upsets are often plentiful, which adds to the tournament&apos;s allure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more and more sports bettors appear to be turning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/artificial-intelligence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to help counter the notoriously unpredictable tournament, which is often referred to as March Madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While AI is certainly a tool that fans can utilize, it is not a perfect science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that AI cannot guarantee results when it comes to sports wagers, another potential downside that should be taken into consideration involves the potential exploitation of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/innovative-ai-powered-approach-to-sports-handicapping-continues-push-to-reshape-betting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INNOVATIVE AI-POWERED APPROACH TO SPORTS HANDICAPPING CONTINUES PUSH TO RESHAPE BETTING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are becoming more and more sophisticated. The possibility of manipulating the betting markets and taking advantage of vulnerabilities likely creates a considerable amount of intrigue for hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hacking of sports betting platforms has the potential to not only negatively impact consumer confidence, it can also create serious financial consequences for companies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; are potentially at risk if cyberattacks continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With employees streaming games or participating in online betting pools using company devices and networks, organizations are vulnerable to a range of cyberthreats, from phishing attacks to malware infections,&quot; Advizex&apos;s VP of Strategy Matt Gaudio said in a press release sent to Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, artificial intelligence can sometimes be used to exploit weaknesses in AI-powered sports betting systems. Certain AI-backed algorithms can even be programmed to attack weaknesses in online gambling systems. If hackers are successful, the distorted odds could result in a sizable amount of bets being placed under false guises in a matter of seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity experts estimate AI hacking during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA tournaments&lt;/a&gt; alone could cost American companies more than 18 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the upside to leaning into AI remains significant, especially for those who cannot afford to or simply don&apos;t want to travel to games. Access to television bundles, streaming and 4K television technology has allowed the average fan to watch their favorite team or player from the comfort of their home, even if they do not live in a given team&apos;s home market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms can also be leveraged to allow various sportsbooks to analyze a given bettor&apos;s patterns and interests to show them personalized recommendations. As a result, users are given a variety of new tools that they otherwise would not have without the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;AI will allow for increasingly personal experiences for sports bettors, and customize quests for users, building upon the type of quests they tend to accept and complete,&quot; said Dan Taren, founder of sports betting platform Scrimmage told Boardroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is powerful for operators we integrate with to help their users make their betting experience feel personalized to them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enjoyed in moderation and when spending limits are put in place, sports wagering gambling can be a fun and exciting way to enjoy a game. However, it is important that players are aware of the importance of responsible gambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Miller, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association, shared that a responsible gambler does not rely on gambling as a source of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As someone approaches the Super Bowl or March Madness or any other sporting event where they&apos;re thinking about making the game a little bit more fun or a little bit more interesting, one, it&apos;s supposed to be fun. No one should ever believe they are going to make a living or a second job placing wagers on sporting events,&quot; Miller told Fox News Digital last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gamblers should also have a specific budget in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And number two, you set a budget, and you stick to that budget,&quot; he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Six New York inmates will be able to see the total solar eclipse after reaching a settlement with the corrections department following a lawsuit claiming violation of religious rights.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Six inmates at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York state prison&lt;/a&gt; will be allowed to watch next week&apos;s total solar eclipse after they sued the corrections department following its decision to lock down facilities during the rare event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inmates – Jeremy Zielinski, Travis Hudson, Bruce Moses, Oscar Nuñez, Jean Marc Desmarat and David Haigh – filed a federal lawsuit after claiming the lockdown decision infringes on their religious rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint described the solar eclipse as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;religiously significant event&lt;/a&gt; and said it is &quot;recognized by various religions as special events that warrant gathering, celebration, worship, and prayer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A settlement allowing the inmates to view the event was reached with the state Department of Corrections on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-inmates-sue-corrections-department-watch-solar-eclipse-planned-prison-lockdowns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK INMATES SUE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO WATCH SOLAR ECLIPSE AMID PLANNED PRISON LOCKDOWNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alston &amp;amp; Bird, the law firm working for the plaintiffs, filed a voluntary discontinuance on Thursday following the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are pleased that, in response to our lawsuit alleging religious discrimination, New York State has entered into a binding settlement agreement that will allow our six clients to view the solar eclipse in accordance with their sincerely held religious beliefs,&quot; a statement from Christopher L. McArdle, Alston &amp;amp; Bird partner, read Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/solar-eclipse-safety-drivers-should-not-do-road-rare-event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FOR SOLAR ECLIPSE SAFETY, HERE&apos;S WHAT DRIVERS SHOULD NOT DO ON THE ROAD DURING THE RARE EVENT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All six inmates involved in the matter are incarcerated at the Woodbourne Correctional Facility, which is about 110 miles north of New York City. Their religious beliefs and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;charges for which they are serving time&lt;/a&gt; vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zielinski, 40, is an atheist who was convicted of first-degree rape, according to the New York incarcerated persons database. He also has priors for promoting sexual performance by a child and attempting to disseminate indecent material of a minor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson, 50, is a Baptist who was convicted for course of sexual conduct against a child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moses, 50, is serving time for second-degree assault, second-degree criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a controlled substance. Nuñez, 49, was convicted of second-degree attempted murder. Both men practice Santeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desmarat, 53, a Muslim, is behind bars for second-degree murder and Haigh, 49, a Seventh Day Adventist, was convicted of first-degree manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lockdown decision that prompted the lawsuit was issued in March and stated that all prisons in New York would operate on a holiday schedule on April 8 because of the eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After April 8, the next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxweather.com/category/solar-eclipse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;solar eclipse&lt;/a&gt; will take place in 2044.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital&apos;s Louis Casiano contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Latino voters may make or break the presidential election in swing states like Nevada</title>
                    
                    <description>The latest numbers show the majority of Latino voters in Nevada are registered as non-partisan and make up a key group candidates need to win over.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a swing state like Nevada, every vote will matter in the upcoming presidential election. Latino voters make up nearly one-third of the state’s population and can play a critical role in determining who takes the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest numbers show the majority of Latino voters in Nevada are registered as non-partisan, a key group President Biden and former President Trump will try to win over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nosotros somos la voz para nuestro futuro. It is so important that we all go out to vote not only this primary, but this upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/election&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;election in November&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; said first-time voter Elisa Martinez. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year will be Martinez’s first-time voting, but she’s no stranger to the process. Martinez has been involved with political campaigns since she was a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ahead-2024-presidential-election-swing-state-pennsylvania-sets-election-security-task-force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AHEAD OF 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SWING STATE PENNSYLVANIA SETS UP ELECTION SECURITY TASK FORCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It made me feel like I should take that initiative to always spread the word, so at 12-years-old, I was always telling my family let’s go vote. I’d tell my dad, hey let’s go do this on Election Day, early voting started,&quot; said Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last presidential election, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/latino&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Latino vote&lt;/a&gt; was closer between Biden and Trump compared nationally. For Latinos, there are some issues top of mind right now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Number one, immigration. As a daughter of immigrants, coming from a family of immigrants, I feel that I want to make sure my family is safe and treated with respect. Education is definitely another big issue for me,&quot; said Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6347944589112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMMIGRATION HAS BECOME THE ‘NUMBER ONE ISSUES’ IN THE 2024 RACE: FRANCIS SUAREZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Issues that are really pressing to me are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/fox-news-immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;immigration reform,&lt;/a&gt; especially because I grew up in a community where there’s a bunch of undocumented people, and to me that matters…and healthcare, growing up, my dad was diabetic and undocumented, so it’s really difficult and in order to afford his medicine which involves two different types of insulin and three different types of pills in order to control his blood sugar,&quot; said another first-time voter Jiromi Pena. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/healthcare/family-health-insurance-work-now-costs-24000-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FAMILY HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH WORK NOW COSTS $24,000 A YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiromi Pena also has experience with political campaigns. She says it’s important young voters educate themselves on the candidates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of them don’t know who to vote for, but once you reach out to them and give them the information, then they kind of know what decision to make based off of the experiences they’ve had previously,&quot; said Pena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the young Latino voters in Nevada are not tied to a party, compared to older voters who are more consistent and reliable voters, according to Vote Nevada, a nonprofit focused on voting education.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That’s where our nonpartisan voter registration shot up. If you look at voters 18-34, 61% of them are registered nonpartisan, independent,&quot; said Vote Nevada CEO Sondra Cosgrove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vote Nevada says there needs to be more education surrounding voting, especially catering toward the younger voters so that their voices do not go unheard. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>GREG GUTFELD: &apos;Diversity, equity &amp; inclusion&apos; has done it again</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Gutfeld!&amp;quot; host Greg Gutfeld decries Seattle Public Schools for discontinuing its program for gifted students.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diversity, equity and inclusion — never in the field of human endeavor have so few words done so much harm to so many. It&apos;s almost as bad as &quot;Brian Kilmeade&apos;s here,&quot; but DEI has done it again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-public-schools-replacing-gifted-students-program-inclusive-citing-diversity-concerns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Seattle Public School system&lt;/a&gt; is phasing out its highly capable cohort schools designed for gifted students who could skip the lessons designed for other kids their age. You know, nerds. But just when you thought Seattle couldn&apos;t get any dumber, it does something literally to do just that, and can you guess why? That&apos;s right, because it&apos;s racist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, those programs have too many students from the bad races. Last year, over 50% of the advanced students were White, 16% Asian, 3.4% Black. There just weren&apos;t enough Black, Latino, Indigenous, Alaskan and Pacific Islander students. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/seattle-public-schools-replacing-gifted-students-program-inclusive-citing-diversity-concerns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS REPLACING GIFTED STUDENTS PROGRAM TO BE MORE &apos;INCLUSIVE,&apos; CITING DIVERSITY CONCERNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I guess we could say goodbye to the NBA real soon, right? What&apos;s that? Oh, we don&apos;t use that type of insane reasoning when it&apos;s sports? What a strange demarcation. People say, &quot;Don&apos;t do that with basketball, but let&apos;s do it with less important stuff. You know, like education.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the schools got canceled like it was hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/don-lemon-dropped-by-x-claims-elon-musk-retaliated-over-their-interview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Don Lemon&lt;/a&gt;. And why? Well, it&apos;s not about how smart these kids are. It&apos;s not about what&apos;s up here. It&apos;s about what&apos;s on here. It&apos;s about what these kids look like when they&apos;re in a classroom together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s about embarrassing their teachers and administrators just by being themselves. I don&apos;t know, but that sounds pretty racist to me. So now, instead of putting the brainiacs in their own class with their own teacher and curriculum, all those brats are being lumped together, and the teacher&apos;s expected to come up with different lesson plans for different levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, kids, today&apos;s vocabulary word is mediocrity. Does anyone here know what that means? Mediocrity is what happens when the people who run our country force us all to lower our standards so the elites can pat themselves on the back for their atrocious beliefs. And that&apos;s what it&apos;s about: the continuing destruction caused by luxury beliefs, which are bad ideas that bestow status on the elites who hold them while inflicting pain on everyone else who must endure them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see it with climate activism, criminal justice, and now here in education. An enlightened progressive already has their college degrees, their house and two electric cars, so they&apos;re immune from their own destruction, but God help your kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-punishing-gifted-students-war-merit-honors-programs-hurting-black-children-others&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;STOP PUNISHING GIFTED STUDENTS: WAR ON MERIT, HONORS PROGRAMS IS HURTING BLACK CHILDREN, OTHERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so in Seattle, the smart kids will be reading &quot;The Gutfeld Monologues,&quot; while in the same classroom, the slow kids will be reading &quot;Get It Together&quot; by Jesse Watters. The kids who are already reading Shakespeare are stuck in the same room with the kids still eating boogers and paste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my case, it was both. Glue tastes great, but now I get to eat the whole horse. But today, helping kids of all races advance at their own pace is now considered inequitable, and holding highly intelligent children back is now considered equitable. And yes, that includes Black kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, those who complained about shutting down these schools included Black parents. And guess what the school board VP reportedly told them: They were being tokenized by the White parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was probably in the slow class, which once again, is mind-numbingly racist, but to the elites, it&apos;s as if Black parents don&apos;t have minds of their own, as if they don&apos;t have the same hopes and concerns about their children as everybody else to one day be like me, you know — rich enough to own a helicopter that could drop porta-potties into Kilmeade&apos;s swimming pool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are some of the smartest kids in school being punished for what they look like, but so are the smart kids these &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/radio-host-charlamagne-tha-god-rips-dei-efforts-workplace-mostly-garbage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DEI fanatics&lt;/a&gt; claim to be helping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/parents-speak-against-school-canceling-honors-classes-name-equity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PARENTS SPEAK OUT AGAINST SCHOOL CANCELING HONORS CLASSES IN THE NAME OF EQUITY: ‘IT’S NOT WORKING&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call me old-fashioned, but the only reason kids should be punished for what they look like is if they&apos;re chubby. The smartest kid might be Black, but now he has to sit next to the dumbest kid in school who might be White or Asian. Well, probably not Asian. When I was a kid and we had a test coming up, everybody wanted to sit next to the Asian kid. It&apos;s the only reason George Takei had friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sadly, like it or not, these kids are learning what modern America is all about. It&apos;s not about living up to your potential as an individual. It&apos;s about what you look like as part of the herd, you&apos;re just part of the group you have no control of — which is why I quit Menudo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, anybody who dares to question this is racist, and that includes Black parents who realize their gifted children are being punished, and they&apos;re exactly right. Finally, something every race can agree on, which is why the idiots who make the rules won&apos;t let us. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>SEAN HANNITY: RFK, Jr.&apos;s a &apos;devout, radical environmentalist&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Fox News host Sean Hannity highlights several positions Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. supports on &amp;quot;Hannity.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Sean Hannity lays out &quot;radical&quot; positions he says independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. holds in his opening monologue on &quot;Hannity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEAN HANNITY:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;On the issue of Kennedy, well, he is what he is. He is a devout, radical environmentalist who frequently was heaping praise on Bernie Sanders and his radical &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-would-cost-93-trillion-or-600g-per-household-study-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Green New Deal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. In the past, he&apos;s called for a complete ban on fracking. He&apos;s applauded Obama&apos;s limits on oil exploration, tweeting, &quot;#KeepItInTheGround.&quot; No, I say bring it out of the ground. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rfk-jr-says-biden-much-worse-threat-to-democracy-than-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK, JR. SAYS BIDEN ‘MUCH WORSE’ THREAT TO DEMOCRACY THAN TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway, on his campaign website, RFK, Jr. promises to &quot;protect wild lands from further development by curbing mining, logging, oil drilling, and suburban sprawl,&quot; as he calls it. This will undoubtedly drive up the cost of everything, especially housing — and that&apos;s not all. The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-sounds-alarm-rfk-jr-says-support-voters-not-joke-ross-perot-level&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kennedy campaign&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; also has a plan to dismantle the police. &quot;Kennedy will reorient police to serve, not occupy, Black communities; to keep neighborhoods safe rather than harassing their residents.&quot; There&apos;s also a section on Kennedy&apos;s website about student loan forgiveness. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He plans to make &quot;student debt dischargeable in bankruptcy and cut interest rates on student loans to zero.&quot; Who wants to lend people money and not get interest? Anyway, naturally, small business loans will continue to accrue interest. Here&apos;s another proposal that, well, bleeding-heart liberals will find very tempting: Kennedy wants to slash the U.S. military budget and use the money for socialized healthcare. RFK, Jr.&apos;s running mate? Very wealthy attorney, compelling life story from Silicon Valley. Her name is &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-is-nicole-shanahan-meet-wealthy-entrepreneur-rfk-jr-selected-vp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nicole Shanahan&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; — a devout, far-left Democrat. Notably, by the way, Shanahan has spoken out against in-vitro fertilization. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But thanks to Shanahan, while the Kennedy campaign now has extremely deep pockets, it will pose a serious challenge to Biden&apos;s re-election.

                    <description>Former NFL player and current sports TV analyst Emmanuel Acho is under fire after he appeared to defend some of the criticism directed at LSU star Angel Reese.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL linebacker-&lt;/a&gt;turned-television sports analyst Emmanuel Acho faced some backlash due to recent comments about college basketball star Angel Reese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Tuesday&apos;s edition of the Fox Sports show &quot;Speak,&quot; Acho and the panel began discussing Reese&apos;s emotional press conference when the All-American opened up about some of the criticism she dealt with over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’ve been through so much,&quot; Reese said. &quot;I’ve seen so much. I’ve been attacked so many times, death threats. I’ve been sexualized. I’ve been threatened. I’ve been so many things, and I’ve stood strong every single time,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsu-star-angel-reese-laments-increased-scrutiny-national-title-win-havent-had-peace&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reese said&lt;/a&gt; after LSU lost 94-87 to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Elite Eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I just try to stand strong for my teammates because I don’t want them to see me down and not be there for them. I’m still a human. All this has happened since I won the national championship. I haven’t had peace since then.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acho prefaced his comments by saying he was sharing a &quot;gender-neutral, racially indifferent take&quot; on Reese and her remarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can’t be the big, bad wolf but then cry like Courage the Cowardly Dog,&quot; he said, referencing the Cartoon Network character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-kim-mulkey-posts-proud-message-to-angel-reese-after-reese-declares-for-wnba-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LSU&apos;S KIM MULKEY POSTS PROUD MESSAGE FOR ANGEL REESE AFTER REESE DECLARES FOR WNBA DRAFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acho suggested Reese should have handled the defeat differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you want to act grown, which she has; if you want to get paid like you’re grown, which you are; if you want to talk to grown folks like you’re grown, which you did ... then postgame when you take an ‘L,’ you’ve just got to take it on the chin,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What frustrated me is when you want to be the villain, but you want to hope for sympathy like a hero,&quot; he added. Reese has spoken out about being labeled a villain for her competitive conduct on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmanuelAcho/status/1775282717745431032&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Speak&quot; co-hosts LeSean McCoy and James Jones seemed to agree with Acho&apos;s take. But Acho faced his share of detractors, including his other co-host, Joy Taylor, who questioned why Reese had become publicly known as the &quot;villian.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She didn’t make herself the villain. She showed up unapologetically herself in the same way that men do all the time,&quot; she said, later adding that what Reese &quot;experiences is not the same thing as what everyone is experiencing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acho appeared to take the backlash in stride and took to social media to thank those who he said &quot;respectfully reprimanded&quot; him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not stand on a hill saying that I am right and you are wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I simply stand on a place saying: ‘Hey, this is what I believe. What do you believe? Let’s listen to one another and construct our collective beliefs.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EmmanuelAcho/status/1775938944003375377&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Reese confirmed she plans to leave LSU and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsu-star-angel-reese-declares-wnba-draft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;enter the WNBA Draft&lt;/a&gt;. She is projected to be a top-10 pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese averaged 18.6 points and 13.4 rebounds over 33 games this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

White ordered Amy Leann Hall to serve two sentences of life in a federal penitentiary for the 2018 slayings of her 18-year-old son, Kayson Toliver, and 16-year-old daughter, Kloee Toliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also sentenced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to an additional&lt;/a&gt; 20 years in prison for shooting her 14-year-old daughter. The teen managed to survive the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charges stem after Hall pleaded guilty on Nov. 28, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mom-claims-she-fatally-shot-son-injured-2-daughters-to-save-them-from-abusive-dad-authorities-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MOM CLAIMS SHE FATALLY SHOT SON, INJURED 2 DAUGHTERS TO ‘SAVE’ THEM FROM ABUSEIVE DAD, AUTHORITIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall&apos;s cold-hearted murders of her teens happened at the family&apos;s Oklahoma home on Nov. 1, 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Authorities said that&lt;/a&gt; while her children slept, the 38-year-old entered her 18-year-old son&apos;s room and shot him in the head while he slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall proceeded to the bedroom of her 16- and 14-year-old daughters, and shot both in the head as they slept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 14-year-old survived, while Kloee never regained consciousness and died from her injuries four days later at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Her murder plan&lt;/a&gt; was interrupted after Hall left the scene in a vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She led police on a wild car chase, reaching speeds close to 100 mph until police stopped her several miles from the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police then took her into custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/second-teen-dies-of-gunshot-wound-after-oklahoma-moms-rampage-authorities-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECOND TEEN DIES OF GUNSHOT WOUND AFTER OKLAHOMA MOM&apos;S RAMPAGE, AUTHORITIES SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall claimed she was trying to &quot;save&quot; her children from their abusive father, police said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she also intended &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/suicide-warning-signs-missed-most-americans-new-survey-finds-alarming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to kill herself.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said that she and the children&apos;s father were separated, and engaged in a two-year custody battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oct. 2018, Hall filed an emergency order asking for temporary sole custody of the children. In 2016, the father claimed that Hall was mentally unstable and was psychologically abusive to the children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials told FOX 23 they had previously responded to the home on domestic calls, but nothing had led to any arrests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayson was a standout running back on the Beggs High School Golden Demons football team, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tulsaworld.com/news/state/vigil-held-for-okmulgee-county-football-player-allegedly-killed-by/article_3abdbed9-2b24-5086-98ed-a7def6c01314.html&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tulsa World&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. He led the offense in what was his senior season with 580 yards and five touchdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toliver was also named a National Honor Society student in June, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The horrific violence visited upon this family was unimaginable, and nothing will ever make things right,&quot; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Oklahoma Christopher J. Wilson said in a statement. &quot;Nevertheless, justice requires a careful consideration of all facts, including the interests of the surviving victim. Based on these considerations, the United States recommended a life sentence be imposed in this case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An Indian national convicted of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;child sex offenses&lt;/a&gt;, but given light sentences, was arrested last month after he was released from a Maryland detention center without any warning to federal immigration authorities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (CBP) said Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unidentified 32-year-old man was arrested March 20 near his home in Ellicott City, 38 miles north of Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This predator’s presence in our area constituted a significant threat to the children of our Maryland neighborhoods,&quot; said Matthew Elliston, the acting field office director for Baltimore&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;ICE Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; and Removal Operations. &quot;We cannot allow non-citizen sex offenders to roam the streets of our community.

He was arrested by CBP officers on Nov. 14, 2021, while trying to board a Qatar Airlines flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Queens, New York,&lt;/a&gt; to Doha, Qatar, ICE said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest stemmed from a warrant out of Montgomery County, Maryland child sex offenses, an ICE news release states. He was placed on sex offender parole by the CBP until Nov. 12, 2022, and turned over to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department for extradition to Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBP lodged an immigration detainer against him with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Brooklyn, New York. He was subsequently taken into custody by the Montgomery County Police Department, and he was charged with sex abuse of a minor and four counts of sex offense in the third degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 15, 2022, Maryland’s Howard County Police Department also arrested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/india&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Indian citizen&lt;/a&gt; and charged him with two counts of sex abuse of a minor, and two counts of sex offense in the third degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another detainer was allegedly placed for him at the Howard County Detention Center, Feb. 16, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BORDER CRISIS IMPACTS IMMIGRATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 10 of that year, he was convicted by a Montgomery County court. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for sex abuse of a minor charge, but a judge suspended all but 18 months of the sentence. He was also sentenced to 10 years for a charge of sex offense in the third degree, but the judge suspended all 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was eventually placed on five years of supervised probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two weeks later, the suspect was convicted and sentenced in a Howard County court to another 10-year sentence for a sex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;offense&lt;/a&gt; in the third degree. Just like in Montgomery County, the Howard County court judge suspended all but 18 months of the sentence, ICE said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An immigration detainer hold was lodged with the Howard County Detention Center on Feb. 1, and the suspect was issued a notice on Feb. 25, to appear before an immigration judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Howard County Detention Center refused to honor ERO Baltimore’s immigration detainer and released the Indian sex offender from custody March 20,&quot; an ICE statement said. &quot;Later that day, deportation officers from ERO Baltimore’s Criminal Apprehension Program arrested him in Ellicott City.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal immigration judge ordered the man to be deported to India. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Former college football coach Scott Frost &apos;dying&apos; for second chance: &apos;I don&apos;t know what&apos;s next&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>Despite being the hottest name in college football coaching circles at one time, Scott Frost hasn&amp;apos;t found a new job since his time on the sideline came to an abrupt halt in 2022.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was not that long ago that Scott Frost helped the University of Central Florida Knights rise to prominence. He quickly became one of the more sought-after coaching candidates in college football and eventually made the leap &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/nebraska-cornhuskers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;to Nebraska&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frost had some success during his stint as the Cornhuskers&apos; head coach, but his time in Lincoln came to a screeching halt early in the 2022 season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frost sat out the 2023 season and has not found a new job. But the former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;college football&lt;/a&gt; coach appears to be itching for another opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the first time in my life, I don&apos;t know what&apos;s next,&quot; the former Nebraska coach told CBS Sports. &quot;I&apos;m dying to get back in.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; id=&quot;OWAf6c5c263-e13c-683a-7fc7-ddeedfa65589&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frost was the 2017 AP College Football Coach of the Year and won the Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Coach of the Year Award. He coached the Knights to an undefeated season in 2017, before returning to his alma mater, Nebraska, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 schools have replaced their head coaches since Frost&apos;s 2022 departure, including Nebraska. Former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Carolina Panthers&lt;/a&gt; head coach Matt Rhule is Nebraska&apos;s current coach. Although Frost appeared to draw interest from some universities, none hired him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nick-saban-sending-emails-learning-table-etiquette-wifes-ten-commandments-retirement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NICK SABAN SENDING EMAILS AND LEARNING TABLE ETIQUETTE AS PART OF WIFE&apos;S &apos;TEN COMMANDMENTS OF RETIREMENT&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Frost is anxious to get back into coaching, he also seems to be appreciative of the extra time he has to spend with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frost seems to be looking forward instead of dwelling on past mistakes. He also said he does not want to publicly disparage his former program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is bad to say to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;media guy&lt;/a&gt;, but I&apos;ve never wanted to be a critic,&quot; Frost said. &quot;I&apos;ve wanted to be in the arena.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nebraska remains on the hook for a significant buyout, Frost also remains open to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NFL coaching&lt;/a&gt; opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My whole life I was a Little League player and a high school player and then a college player and then an NFL player and then a [graduate assistant] and then a position coach, then a coordinator and then a head coach,&quot; Frost said. &quot;It was on a trajectory, and I knew what was next.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college football landscape looks vastly different from when Frost was on the sidelines. Name, image and likeness (NIL) was still a relatively new concept when Frost was coaching, and the transfer portal was just a few weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a coach, Nick Saban said it,&quot; Frost said. &quot;It used to be a 45-week-a-year job. Now, it&apos;s a 52-week-a-year job. You&apos;re scouting other teams&apos; players, recruiting year-round, raising money for NIL year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The part I love about college football [is] taking an 18-year-old kid and watching him leave as a 22-year-old man who has life figured out. You played a part in that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>JESSE WATTERS: Biden&apos;s economic boom is not for Americans, but for illegal immigrants</title>
                    
                    <description>&amp;quot;Jesse Watters Primetime&amp;quot; host Jesse Watters claims President Biden has created 5 million migrant jobs amid the president&amp;apos;s touting his administration&amp;apos;s economic success.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News host Jesse Watters reacts to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell allegedly confessing to a &quot;migrant job fair&quot; on &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/shows/jesse-watters-primetime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Jesse Watters Primetime&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/tyson-hiring-migrants-laying-off-us-workers-decimation-american-dream-top-republican&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TYSON HIRING MIGRANTS WHILE LAYING OFF US WORKERS IS THE &apos;DECIMATION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM&apos;: TOP REPUBLICAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JESSE WATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Fed chair just confessed that &quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-on-fox-major-conservative-group-unveils-bidenomics-com-target-presidents-economic-policies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bidenomics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot; is just a migrant job fair. There are actually a million less American citizens working today than there were in 2020. As the U.S. economy reopened after the pandemic, Biden has created 5 million migrant jobs. 5 million jobs, not for people born here, born somewhere else. Illegal immigrants walk across the border, Biden busses them to New York, and after 150 days, they&apos;re allowed to work. This is the great replacement theory the Democrats said is so racist. Nah, couldn&apos;t be. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Biden economy is a mirage, a migrant mirage. It gets even more suspicious. All of these jobs Biden has claimed to have created, millions of them are part-time jobs. Since June, America has lost 2 million full-time jobs. The so-called Biden comeback is a scandal. The president is illegally flooding &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-says-farmers-need-illegal-immigrants-pick-crops-florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;American industry with cheap labor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. Less native born Americans are working, and millions of us are having to take second and part-time jobs. This pushes our wages down and at the same time triggers inflation. The media knows this, but they don&apos;t care who does the work and who loses out. They just want to be served by someone, anyone, as cheaply and quickly as possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>PGA Tour star Jordan Spieth dazzles with hole-in-one at Valero Texas Open</title>
                    
                    <description>Jordan Spieth hit the perfect tee shot on hole 16 of his opening round at the Valero Texas Open, dropping the ball in for a hole-in-one, the third of his career.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas native&lt;/a&gt; Jordan Spieth buried a hole-in-one in his home state, sending the Valero Texas Open crowd into a frenzy on the 16th hole Thursday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spieth wasn’t too happy when he walked up to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;16th tee box&lt;/a&gt;, after his double-bogey on the par-5 14th pushed his opening round at the tournament to 4-over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that all changed when he struck a perfect fade off the tee and sent his ball flying straight to the flag 183 yards away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spieth and the crowd watched as the ball bounced perfectly on the green and made its way toward the hole. It never deviated from its line, which was right in the heart of the cup as it fell in for a hole-in-one. It was the third of his PGA Tour career. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd went wild, and even though he didn’t play his best golf Thursday, he threw his hands in the air to celebrate. Perhaps it was a sigh of relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GolfChannel/status/1776018190604095954&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIEW THE MOMENT ON X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spieth began his opening round with a bogey on the first hole and picked up another one on the fourth before back-to-back birdies on five and six got him back to even. But the roller coaster continued with a bogey on seven and one on nine put him at 2-over in his first nine holes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tiger-woods-abstaining-sex-remain-laser-focused-masters-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIGER WOODS ABSTAINING FROM SEX TO REMAIN LASER FOCUSED FOR MASTERS: REPORT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had another bogey at 11, though a birdie on hole 12 negated that. The hole-in-one, though, seemed to put Spieth on the right track to finish strong. He birdied 17 before making par on 18 to end with a 1-over 73. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With golf’s first major of the year next week — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/golf/the-masters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the 2024 Masters&lt;/a&gt; — many who are invited like to take a week off to prepare for Augusta National Golf Club. Spieth, though, enjoys playing in his home state and clearly wants to stay in tournament mode before heading down to Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spieth is likely hoping to pick up where he left off Thursday instead of the up-and-down scoring he saw in his opening round. His finish has him tied for 76th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a struggle the last two outings for Spieth, who was cut from both The Players Championship and the Valspar Championship in back-to-back outings. However, he is 37th in FedEx Cup points (501) after two top 10 finishes this year, including a third-place finish at The Sentry to open the new year and a sixth-place finish at the WM Phoenix Open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spieth has a green jacket in his closet as the 2015 champion at Augusta National.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Fox News host Laura Ingraham unpacks the &amp;apos;war against women&amp;apos; on &amp;apos;The Ingraham Angle.&amp;apos;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fox News&apos; Laura Ingraham argues the Biden administration&apos;s proposed rule changes to Title IX will make it easier for biological men to compete against girls and women in sports Thursday on &quot;The Ingraham Angle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LAURA INGRAHAM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;The real war against women. That&apos;s the focus of tonight&apos;s &quot;Angle.&quot; Now, the LSU- Iowa NCAA semifinals on Monday night was the highest-rated in NCAA women&apos;s basketball history. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lsus-angel-reese-gives-iowas-caitlin-clark-a-taste-of-her-own-medicine-in-national-title-win-ignites-debate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Iowa star forward Caitlin Clark&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, the best woman to ever play college basketball, is attracting an entirely new fan base. Other stars, like Angel Reese, have huge followings as well-- an enormous talent, and the rivalries? Man, they&apos;re exciting to watch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-releases-new-title-ix-regulations-transgender-issues-schools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN ADMIN RELEASES NEW TITLE IX REGULATIONS ON TRANSGENDER ISSUES IN SCHOOLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yeah, she kind of pushed past all the controversies, and she was poised and powerful and so inspiring to young players and people who aren&apos;t involved in sports. Now, as a former college athlete myself, I do know how much time and how much hard work these women have devoted to becoming the best of the best. Just like the male athletes, they earn every award they get, and no one should ever diminish their achievements. But that is exactly what the Biden administration will do. And it&apos;s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-admin-releases-new-title-ix-rules-bars-states-banning-transgender-students-competing-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;proposing rule changes to Title IX&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; that will make it easier for biological men to compete against girls and women in sports across the United States. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now, it doesn&apos;t matter that they&apos;re now claiming to have delayed it. So, how would it actually do this? Because by redefining the law&apos;s prohibition against sex discrimination to include gender identity, they would &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/us-olympic-rower-patricia-spratlen-etem-calls-biden-administrations-proposed-title-ix-changes-awful-threat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;upend women&apos;s sports&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. And I think they already were beginning to feel the blowback. According to one analysis, this would be catastrophic for female athletes. President Joe Biden would have the federal government compel schools, colleges and universities to allow biological males who identify as females to compete against female athletes. Now, of course, Biden and Harris, they try to sell themselves, as the big defenders of girl power, the true protectors of women. But that&apos;s always been a lie.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now forget the rank unfairness, given the physical advantage that biological men have over women. We&apos;ve been through that ad nauseam. Trans-infiltration of women&apos;s sports put women in actual danger. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Human leg discovered in Wisconsin park, police investigating as homicide</title>
                    
                    <description>Deputies are investigating what they are calling a &amp;quot;suspicious death&amp;quot; after a human leg was discovered inside a Milwaukee area park on April 2.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Milwaukee County Sheriff&apos;s Office has opened an investigation after a gruesome discovery was made when a resident found a human leg inside a community park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the leg was discovered at Warnimont Park on Tuesday, April 2, just before 5:30 p.m., &quot;in or near the water&quot; along Lake Michigan east of the golf course by the pump house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Burnett, acting Chief of Staff with the Milwaukee County Sheriff&apos;s Office, told Fox News Digital that authorities are investigating the severed leg as a homicide. He said a person of interest was in custody. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett said the Milwaukee County Dispatch Center was notified about a human leg being found when a park patron walking in the park called in to report the grotesque discovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/missouri-firefighters-fiancee-autopsy-reveals-suspicious-scenario-experts-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSOURI FIREFIGHTER&apos;S FIANCÉE AUTOPSY REVEALS &apos;SUSPICIOUS&apos; SCENARIO, EXPERTS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hemmer, a frequent visitor of the park, told Fox 6 that the discovery was very disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very shocking. This is such a quiet area,&quot; Hemmer said. &quot;It’s just amazing to me. In a quiet area like this, something so heinous could happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park is located in Cudahy, Wisconsin, a small suburb about eight miles &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;southeast of downtown Milwaukee.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned residents are questioning how this happened and where the leg came from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/2-missing-nh-children-found-alive-moms-suspicious-death-father-custody&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MISSING NH CHILDREN FOUND ALIVE FOLLOWING MOM&apos;S SUSPICIOUS DEATH; FATHER IN CUSTODY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We come here often, and we regard it as a safe place for the family to go walking, and to hear about something like this is quite a shock,&quot; Eric Ruckstadter, another park visitor told Fox 6.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the gruesome discovery, Ruckstadter told Fox 6 that it won&apos;t keep him from going to the park, but he said he is staying aware of his surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As long as there are other people around like there is frequently, I’ll feel safe,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnett said that there is very limited information at this point to share as to not disrupt the investigation, but he could confirm the leg was human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Deputies have not disclosed&lt;/a&gt; the process of how they will identify who the leg belongs to or where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Madonna fires back at concert lawsuit, claims &apos;no Madonna fan&apos; would expect her to take stage at ticketed time</title>
                    
                    <description>Madonna is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges fans were deceived by the Material Girl when she took the stage two hours late at a Brooklyn concert.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Madonna has fired back at a lawsuit brought by two fans unhappy she took the stage at a New York concert in December &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/madonna-fans-furious-after-starts-concert-late&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;two hours later&lt;/a&gt; than the scheduled start time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing obtained Wednesday by Fox News Digital, Madonna’s lawyers requested the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing the plaintifs&apos; claims of having to &quot;get up early to go to work&quot; after the concert ended after 1 a.m. is not an &quot;injury&quot; worthy of damages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Plaintiffs speculate that ticketholders who left the venue after 1 a.m. might have had trouble getting a ride home or might have needed to wake up early the next day for work,&quot; Madonna’s dismissal motion stated. &quot;That is not a cognizable injury.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two concertgoers, Michael Fellows and Jonathan Hadden, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/entertainment/madonna-sued-by-concertgoers-for-allegedly-starting-show-2-hours-late-negligent-misrepresentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;filed the class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in January, arguing the &quot;defendants failed to provide any notice to the ticketholders that the Concerts would start much later than the start time printed on the ticket and as advertised, which resulted in the ticketholders waiting for hours for the Concerts to begin at the Venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/madonna-believes-spoke-god-during-near-death-hospitalization-serious-bacterial-infection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MADONNA BELIEVES SHE SPOKE TO GOD DURING ‘NEAR-DEATH’ HOSPITALIZATION FOR SERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ticketholders leaving the Venue after 1:00 a.m. were confronted with limited public transportation, limited ride-sharing, and/or increased public and private transportation costs at that late hour. In addition, many ticketholders who attended concerts on a weeknight had to get up early to go to work and/or take care of their family responsibilities the next day.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motion said that &quot;nowhere&quot; on the ticket for her Brooklyn concert &quot;did Defendants advertise that Madonna would take the stage at 8:30 p.m., and no reasonable concertgoer —and certainly no Madonna fan — would expect the headline act at a major arena concert to take the stage at the ticketed event time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rather, a reasonable concertgoer would understand that the venue’s doors will open at or before the ticketed time, one or more opening acts may perform while attendees arrive and make their way to their seats and before the headline act takes the stage, and the headline act will take the stage later in the evening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madonna’s lawyers wrote that concertgoers at Barclays Center &quot;got just what they paid for: a full-length, high-quality show by the Queen of Pop,&quot; adding that Hadden posted on Facebook after the show that it was &quot;[i]ncredible, as always!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motion added that the lawsuit &quot;concedes that Madonna fans, like Mr. Hadden, would not expect Madonna to appear onstage at the printed 8:30 p.m. event time, alleging that she has a ‘years-long history’ of ‘arriving several hours late to prior concerts,’ such that ‘Plaintiffs knew or should have known that the Concerts would not start at 8:30 p.m.’&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madonna performed the concerts as part of her Celebration tour after she delayed them from July due to illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motion added, &quot;Reasonable concertgoers also know that concert lengths vary based on numerous factors, such as the duration of the opening act and the artist&apos;s set list for the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, they would not reasonably expect the night to end by 10:30 p.m. unless an advertisement or ticket says as much, and none did here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Nation and Barclay’s Center are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to reps for Madonna for comment. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>An illegal immigrant that just crossed into the U.S. from Mexico about two weeks ago, is accused of viciously stabbing his wife to death in front of their two young children.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An illegal immigrant that just crossed the border into the U.S. illegally around two weeks ago, is accused of brutally stabbing his wife to death and nearly decapitating her – in front of their two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, 2024, at approximately 11:30 a.m., Baltazar Perez-Estrada entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Carol Stream Police Department&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois and informed authorities that he had stabbed his wife, Maricela Simon Franco, 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers said they took Perez-Estrada into custody and immediately opened an investigation. Through the course of their investigation, authorizes discovered Perez-Estrada had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico illegally. He was charged with alien inadmissibility, given a future court date and allowed to continue on his way into the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege Perez-Estrada and his wife got into a verbal fight around 10 p.m. at the apartment where they were staying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youngkin-mourns-dog-stabbed-ms-13-gang-members-held-accountable&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUNGKIN MOURNS K-9 DOG STABBED TO DEATH BY &apos;BARBARIC&apos; MS-13 GANG MEMBERS: &apos;WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said the fight turned physical and Perez-Estrada stabbed Franco dozens of times in her head, neck, body and hands. Prosecutors said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;attack was so violent&lt;/a&gt; that Franco was nearly decapitated. She was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple have two young children, who police said were both present at the time of the alleged murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/montana-governor-begs-biden-job-secure-southern-border-mexican-cartels-infiltrate-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MONTANA GOVERNOR BEGS BIDEN TO &apos;DO HIS JOB&apos; AND SECURE SOUTHERN BORDER AS MEXICAN CARTELS INFILTRATE STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;First and foremost, I offer my sincerest condolences to Maricela’s surviving family and friends on their loss and wish them strength as they continue their lives without the love and support provided by Maricela,&quot; DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not only has this senseless and brutal act removed Maricela from their lives, but it has robbed two young children of their mother. As domestic violence continues to victimize so many, law enforcement within DuPage County stands ready to partner with available social service programs to provide a sustainable resolution to those in need,&quot; Carol Stream Chief of Police Don Cummings said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/michigan-columnist-warns-republicans-seize-alleged-illegal-immigrant-murders-critical-swing-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MICHIGAN COLUMNIST WARNS REPUBLICANS WILL &apos;SEIZE&apos; ON ALLEGED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MURDERS IN CRITICAL SWING STATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlin also echoed Cummings and said prosecutors are working to bring justice to Franco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The extremely violent end to a young mother’s life is something that should touch us all. Domestic violence continues to be a scourge on society, claiming more than ten million victims a year in some form or fashion. In this case, the sad reality is, Maricela’s life has been reduced to a statistic of domestic violence due to the alleged actions of her husband, Baltazar Perez-Estrada. This brutal, senseless act of violence alleged against Mr. Perez-Estrada will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,&quot; Berlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the court granted the state&apos;s motion to detain Perez-Estrada pre-trial. He&apos;s been charged with five counts of first-degree murder and is due back in court on April 25.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bombing kills co-founder of Syria&apos;s main al-Qaida-linked group, once known as Nusra Front</title>
                    
                    <description>Abu Maria al-Qahtani, the co-founder of Syria&amp;apos;s main al-Qaida-linked group, was killed Thursday by a suicide bomber in the northwestern part of the country, according to a war monitor.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;IDLIB, Syria (AP) — A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/12-arrested-connection-pakistan-suicide-bombing-killed-5-chinese-nationals&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;suicide bomber&lt;/a&gt; set off his explosives late on Thursday in northwestern &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/federal-judge-orders-iran-syria-pay-191m-hamas-slaying-american-israeli-activist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, killing the co-founder of the country&apos;s main al-Qaida-linked group that controls much of the northwest, a war monitor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some activists disputed the source of the explosion, saying instead that a remotely detonated bomb killed Abu Maria al-Qahtani, whose real name was Maysara al-Jubouri. Al-Qahtani co-founded the Nusra Front in Syria, a militant group that later renamed itself Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and claimed it had severed ties with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-believed-house-suspected-new-al-qaeda-leader-un-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/violence-syria-rises-aid-dries-up-civil-war-begins-14th-year&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIOLENCE IN SYRIA RISES, AID DRIES UP AS CIVIL WAR BEGINS 14TH YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Britain-based Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor with a network of activists on the ground, the bomber entered al-Qahtani’s guesthouse in the town of Sarmada in Idlib province late in the evening and detonated his explosives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small enclave of northwestern Syria is the country&apos;s last rebel-held territory. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham controls the northwestern Idlib province while Turkey-backed opposition groups control northern Aleppo province. Most of the 4.5 million people living in Idlib and Aleppo provinces rely on humanitarian aid to survive, and almost half live in displacement camps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killing of al-Qahtani came against the backdrop of protests against his group and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, over the militants&apos; harsh reign over the region and deteriorating economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was released from jail in March after being detained by his own men in August over misuse of social media. According to the Observatory, he was accused of communicating with hostile groups. He had since been dismissed from his duties as a senior official for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Observatory said that shortly after the explosion, al-Qahtani was rushed to Bab al-Hawa Hospital in Idlib but died of his wounds. According to the war monitor, two of guests at al-Qahtani&apos;s house were also wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a medical official told The Associated Press that al-Qahtani&apos;s escort and eight other guests were wounded, nine in all. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was no authorities to talk to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public sentiment against al-Golani and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has been rising since the militant group cracked down on senior members and suppressed street protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al-Qahtani, an Iraqi citizen, had been a longtime al-Qaida member who fought against U.S. forces in Iraq following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. In 2011, he was one of several al-Qaida figures who moved to Syria, months after the country’s ongoing deadly conflict began.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The bipartisan centrist political group No Labels announced Thursday it would decline to field a presidential candidate in the 2024 election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Labels National Political Director Joe Cunningham, a former Democratic congressman from South Carolina, told Fox News the decision was not made lightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me say, it&apos;s not for lack of trying,&quot; Cunningham &lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;said on &quot;Your World.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The short answer is that to field this ticket, No Labels was looking for a hero, and a hero never emerged.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham reiterated No Labels&apos; rubric for putting forward a candidate for a third-party bid: Americans calling for a third option to President Biden and former President Trump, and the determination their candidate would have a pathway to win the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/manchin-new-hampshire-appearance-fuels-third-party-spoiler-fears-among-democrats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MANCHIN&apos;S NH APPEARANCE FUELS THIRD-PARTY, SPOILER FEARS AMONG DEMOCRATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s where we ran into a bit of trouble – at the end of the day, we weren&apos;t able to find candidates that we felt had a straightforward path to victory in this,&quot; said Cunningham, who himself helmed an upset in a red district near Charleston that had been represented by former South Carolina GOP Gov. Mark Sanford at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &quot;Your World,&quot; host Neil Cavuto noted that some politicians who seemed primed for a No Labels bid, like outgoing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/2024-election-huge-opening-joe-manchin-aligned-no-labels-party-threatens-spoil-race-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V.&lt;/a&gt;, had seemed to &quot;drop out&quot; of otherwise unstated contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, a Trump critic whose name had been bandied about as a potential third-party candidate, stepped down from his No Labels post in January, and soon announced a GOP bid in the Maryland U.S. Senate primary against former state Del. Robin Ficker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogan leads in recent polling over his two prospective Democratic opponents, Prince George&apos;s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks and Rep. David Trone, D-Md., in what would be a major upset for the Republican Party in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/perot-debate-arises-over-rfk-jr-viability-left-democratic-contest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PEROT 2.0: DEBATE ARISES OVER RFK JR&apos;S VIABILITY IN DEMOCRATIC CONTEST&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavuto also reported former &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chris-christie-withdraws-consideration-no-labels-presidential-run&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie&apos;s&lt;/a&gt; name had been rumored to be in the mix for a third-party bid, and that there was a chance No Labels could not make it onto enough state ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;d respectfully disagree that we had an issue with the ballot access. We were on 21 states as of today. Getting ballot access in all 50 states plus D.C. was not going to be our challenge,&quot; Cunningham replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a major consideration was the political headwind that No Labels faced in the current environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;[P]ushing back against your respective political party is difficult in this duopoly, and the establishment does not reward dissent,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We found it difficult to find the leaders to step up with the courage to be able to say, &apos;OK, we&apos;re putting our country first and, you know, damn the consequences within our respective parties.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the end of the day, that&apos;s essentially what we&apos;re running up against… &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know that millions of Americans are disappointed to learn about this news,&quot; he said. &quot;The common-sense majority that needs a voice, and at No Labels, we&apos;re going to continue to be a voice for that common-sense majority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham said the group, to his knowledge, was never in talks with independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and when pressed by Cavuto, said that although No Labels does not advocate for or against other candidates, he personally would choose Biden over Trump at this juncture. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Marjorie Taylor Greene&apos;s red line on Speaker Johnson</title>
                    
                    <description>Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is already looking to dump House Speaker Mike Johnson, less then a year after an incredibly messy speaker election</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., wants to dump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mike-johnson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She authored a resolution to force the House to take a vote of no confidence in the speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I do not wish to inflict pain on our conference and to throw the House in chaos. But this is basically a warning,&quot; said Greene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene railed at Johnson for negotiating spending bills with Democrats and forgoing the GOP’s internal rule, requiring 72 hours before voting on legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/i-want-my-mtv-motion-vacate-speaker-johnson-faces-potential-threat-congress-returns&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I WANT MY MTV (MOTION TO VACATE): SPEAKER JOHNSON FACES POTENTIAL THREAT WHEN CONGRESS RETURNS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene might not succeed in her effort to topple Johnson. Especially since Republicans just tried this stunt in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Johnson benefits from the terrible example that was set several months ago when (former House Speaker Kevin) McCarthy, R-Calif., was ousted,&quot; said David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron. &quot;It was utter chaos. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The House was completely dysfunctional&lt;/a&gt;. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s an appetite, even among those in the right flank of the Republican Party, to go through that process again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why many Republicans loathe a repeat of last fall’s pandemonium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This whole episode of removing speakers and threatening speakers does nobody any good except the Democrat Party,&quot; Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., said on Fox Business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This internecine fighting is partly what prompted some Republicans to quit early as Johnson tries to mend the threadbare GOP majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve got to unify when you have such a small majority,&quot; Johnson implored on Fox. &quot;I think people feel the gravity and the weight of this. The importance of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House Republican majority&lt;/a&gt; dwindles to a single vote, it wouldn’t take much for things to go haywire. Especially if Greene is intent on forcing her colleagues to vote on removing Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The majority is so narrow that if a couple of Republicans don&apos;t show up or decide not to vote, you could end up with the Democrats in charge of the House,&quot; said Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., left two weeks ago before his term expired in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., planned to retire in January, but he’s out the door by mid-month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more GOP members make Irish exits, Johnson concedes a flip of power for the House of Representatives before the election isn’t out of the question. That would potentially earn House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., a promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, that&apos;s a risk. But I don&apos;t think that&apos;s going to happen,&quot; Johnson told Fox. &quot;Hakeem is not going to be the speaker.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But lawmakers are exasperated at the infighting. Mayhem gripped the House for months over various spending bills and multiple flirtations with potential government shutdowns. Scrapes over who should be House speaker test the patience of members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s absolutely possible that, before the end of the year is out, the Democrats may seize control of the House of Representatives,&quot; said Cohen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, lawmakers are struggling to figure things out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What you&apos;re seeing is an inflection point for the institution,&quot; said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/chip-roy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;And are we going to make this institution work again?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roy criticized Republican leaders on the spending bills. But he also flagged Republican colleagues who are willing to punt to the election and bank on former President Trump returning to the White House as a salve to the nation’s ills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Roy wants Congress&lt;/a&gt; to legislate. And do it now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why the hell are you in Congress? We&apos;re actually supposed to be more important than the president of the United States. That&apos;s why we&apos;re Article One (of the Constitution). But we&apos;re too chicken to use the power,&quot; Roy excoriated during a floor speech. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roy’s not the only one perturbed about the House. Buck departed early because he was also incensed with his colleagues. But for different reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not comfortable with how this institution is structured,&quot; said Buck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck was one of three House Republicans who bucked their party on the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Their resistance sunk impeachment on the first try. However, the GOP-controlled House took a mulligan and impeached Mayorkas a week later after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., returned from cancer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/simply-lieberman-independent-politics-late-connecticut-democrat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMPLY ‘LIEBERMAN’: THE INDEPENDENT AND ENIGMATIC POLITICS OF THE LATE CONNECTICUT DEMOCRAT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck argued that Republicans abused impeachment. He’s suspicious about the motives of his former colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of them are here because they got here by throwing bombs. And they&apos;re going to stay by throwing bombs,&quot; said Buck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Buck, Gallagher also opposed impeaching Mayorkas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s getting harder to get stuff done,&quot; said Gallagher. &quot;I think you see a lot of members frustrated with that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher says there’s one thing he won’t miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fundraising,&quot; said Gallagher. &quot;I hate fundraisers. It’s weird, and it dominates so much of people’s time here. And I think it takes away from the actual serious business of legislating.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). That’s the House GOP’s official campaign arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you see a lot of senior people with a lot of good experience leaving, you know, it&apos;s still kind of disappointing,&quot; said Hudson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he notes that more &lt;i&gt;Democrats &lt;/i&gt;are retiring than Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don&apos;t have a single retirement in a competitive seat. Whereas the Democrats have more retirements than we do. And seven of their retirements are in seats that we&apos;re going to pick up,&quot; said Hudson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might be the case in November. But what about now? And does Johnson cling to power?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox is told the House won’t put a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ukraine aid bill&lt;/a&gt; on the floor right away. It’s likely the House first tackles a reauthorization of Section 702 of FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Lawmakers from both sides demand significant reforms to protect Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement and the intelligence community insist the program is essential to protect the U.S. But there are concerns that the government used Section 702 to eavesdrop on Americans. It’s only supposed to intercept communications of foreign nationals. The program goes dark April 19. So expect the House to wrestle with that before Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Johnson turns to Ukraine, does Greene lower the boom? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s possible that Johnson survives – with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/democratic-party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;help of Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. Democrats either use Ukraine as leverage. Or as a way to secure some buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s going to need to rely on Democrats for support,&quot; said Cohen. &quot;He&apos;s going to have to cut some deals.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats didn’t help McCarthy survive last fall. But the calculus could be different for Johnson. Especially if Ukraine is involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the House votes to remove the speaker, who knows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;who Republicans would tap&lt;/a&gt; to succeed him? Republicans burned through three other speaker candidates after they sidelined McCarthy. The tumult of another speaker vacancy would bubble over in the House. That means more members could bolt. That would spark an unprecedented level of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you thought things were bad before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all hinges on Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite Greene’s efforts, she might fall short on both of her goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s about the math.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson might have the votes to stay. And the House likely has more than 300 votes to approve a bill to assist Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the House may need to wade through another round of bedlam first. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New York City &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ericadams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Mayor Eric Adams&lt;/a&gt;, a Democrat, said on Thursday that he hopes Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will see how the city has managed the migrant crisis, during his trip to the Big Apple by offering the Republican governor a complimentary stay at a migrant shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams&apos; comments came shortly before Abbott, who has bussed thousands of migrants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/new-york-city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years, will headline the New York Republican Party&apos;s annual gala Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m going to offer him a stay in one of the HERRCs so he can see what he has created and understand how we are treating people with the dignity and respect that he should have shown as well,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/ViralNewsNYC/status/1775934194050277474?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;Adams said at a press conference&lt;/a&gt; when asked about Abbott&apos;s trip to the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;HERRCs,&quot; as used by Adams, refers to New York City&apos;s humanitarian emergency response and relief centers, which have served as temporary housing facilities for migrants who arrive in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-city-begins-giving-illegal-immigrants-prepaid-debit-cards-part-53-million-pilot-program&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY BEGINS GIVING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PREPAID DEBIT CARDS AS PART OF $53 MILLION PILOT PROGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not quite sure why he&apos;s here and what he&apos;s doing while here, but he&apos;s going to see how you can manage the crisis with the coordination of not one child of families sleeping on the streets of the city of New York,&quot; Adams added. &quot;When we coordinate together, we should not displace problems to local municipalities. That is not what executives do. It is unfortunate that he made the decision to do that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments from Adams, who has repeatedly blasted Abbott for not coordinating with the city on matters of illegal immigration, came after the city began giving out prepaid debit cards to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;illegal immigrants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; residing in the Big Apple last week. The prepaid cards are meant to be for the purchasing of food and baby supplies and may only be used at bodegas, grocery stores, supermarkets and convenience stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort is part of a reported &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-york-city-hand-53-million-pre-paid-credit-cards-migrant-families-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;$53 million pilot program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to hand out prepaid cards to migrant families housed in hotels, despite public outcry. The program, which the mayor&apos;s office confirmed to Fox News Digital will provide migrant families of four with two children under five with up to $350 each week until the end of their 28-day stay, began with a limited number of families last week and is expected to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 180,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since 2022, overwhelming city resources as officials have struggled to find housing for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-hits-major-milestone-for-migrants-sent-to-sanctuary-cities-despite-liberal-fury-we-will-not-back-down&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;bused asylum-seekers to New York&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other cities in an effort to assist them in traveling to sanctuary jurisdictions and also highlight the crisis that border communities face on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-migrant-squatters-drugs-guns-previously-caught-southern-border-released-ice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC MIGRANT SQUATTERS FOUND WITH DRUGS AND GUNS WERE PREVIOUSLY CAUGHT AT SOUTHERN BORDER AND RELEASED: ICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City&apos;s government has projected that it will spend at least $10.6 billion on migrants by summer 2025. New York state has already vowed to contribute about $2 billion in the current budget cycle to the migrant crisis, but Adams told lawmakers that the state pledge would only cover one-third of the city’s migrant costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kathy-hochul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gov. Kathy Hochul&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another Democrat, has suggested the state earmark $2.4 billion to go toward migrant services in the next budget cycle, but the details have not been ironed out before the state legislature. Adams&apos; office said even that allocation proposed by Hochul would be $600 million short of what the city needs in its next budget cycle, the New York Daily News reported in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Adams hopes the Texas Republican will see how NYC has handled the migrant crisis, Abbott is no stranger to mitigating the very same crisis along the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Fox News analysis published in February, nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;7.3 million migrants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are known to have illegally crossed the southwest border since President Biden took office in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number, which came from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is likely to have increased significantly over the past two months, is greater than the populations of 36 individual states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the current pace of illegal immigration does not slow down, fiscal 2024 will break last year&apos;s record of 2,475,669 southwest border encounters — a number that by itself exceeds the population of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/new-mexico&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, a border state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott will serve as the keynote speaker at the Thursday evening GOP fundraiser in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Greg Wehner, Bill Melugin and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Our hope is that this transplant approach will offer a lifeline to millions of patients worldwide who are suffering from kidney failure,&quot; he also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health/arkansas-military-veteran-receives-worlds-first-whole-eye-partial-face-transplant&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;ARKANSAS MILITARY VETERAN RECEIVES WORLD’S FIRST WHOLE-EYE AND PARTIAL-FACE TRANSPLANT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slayman has been a patient at Mass General Transplant Center for 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/surgery&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;successful surgery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; marks a &quot;historic milestone&quot; in xenotransplantation, which is the transplant of organs across species, the hospital noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of procedure could potentially provide an alternative solution to the global organ shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are currently on waiting lists for organ transplants — and 17 of those die each day, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MGH alone, more than 1,400 patients are currently on the waiting list for a kidney transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys top the list of the most commonly needed organs, as end-stage kidney disease is expected to increase by anywhere from 29% to 69% by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MGH previously performed the world’s first human organ transplant, of a kidney, at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in 1954.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to MGH and additional physicians requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews/health&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;A Florida man was arrested&lt;/a&gt; after he allegedly caused a fight at a Disney World bar while intoxicated when he made fun of a woman with Down syndrome, according to an arrest affidavit from the Orange County Sheriff&apos;s Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the affidavit obtained by Fox News Digital, officers said 61-year-old Brent George was arrested and charged with four counts of battery after the altercation that unfolded at Belle Vue Lounge, a bar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/walt-disney-world-orlando&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;inside Disney&apos;s Boardwalk Inn,&lt;/a&gt; on Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just after 9:00 p.m., on January 25, 2024, officers responded to the bar in response to a physical fight, later determined to be a battery against four victims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When arriving at the scene, officers said George was intoxicated and had several injuries to his face that he claimed were a result of being hit by a glass cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-accused-hitting-walgreens-store-manager-bible-easter-sunday&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORIDA MAN ACCUSED OF HITTING WALGREENS STORE MANAGER WITH BIBLE ON EASTER SUNDAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George told officers that he was in the Belle Vue Lounge, a small bar area in the Boardwalk resort with his wife and two family friends, where he claimed he had taken three shots of bourbon and drank beer while at the bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, the family was sitting at a nearby table when George approached them and started mocking the couple&apos;s daughter, who was described as having Down syndrome and was wheelchair bound. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl&apos;s mother then confronted George and asked him if he was making fun of her daughter when George stood up and allegedly shoved her twice. He proceeded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;allegedly slap another guest&lt;/a&gt; at the table in the face when she tried to intervene, the complaint read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The husband of the woman who was slapped got involved, and George allegedly punched him in the neck. George was then punched in the head by the husband, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/hotel-vp-accused-drunkenly-slapping-teenage-disney-world-restaurant-hostess-over-dress-code-snub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FORMER HOTEL VP ACCUSED OF DRUNKENLY SLAPPING TEENAGE DISNEY WORLD RESTAURANT HOSTESS OVER DRESS CODE SNUB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George allegedly told officers he did not remember anything specific due to being intoxicated. He also said he was having a &quot;good time with the individuals, and then he was attacked by them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the witnesses claimed he saw an individual throw a glass cup at George and overheard someone say they wanted &quot;to kill him.&quot;  However, officers determined there was no broken glass found on the scene, and it is believed no glass cup was utilized in the incident. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unnamed bystander grabbed George and removed him from the scene, according to deputies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George was evaluated by medical staff for the injuries sustained from being punched and was then transported to the Orange County Jail after being cleared.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George pleaded not guilty to all four battery charges in February and, according to court records, his March 13 hearing was canceled. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Texas man convicted of sexual assault on the run after failing to appear in court for sentencing</title>
                    
                    <description>A Texas man is being sought after he didn&amp;apos;t show up to court for his sentencing following his sexual assault conviction, prosecutors said.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Texas man&lt;/a&gt; convicted of sexual assault is on the run after he failed to appear in court for his sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Travis County jury found Hai Vo guilty of aggravated sexual assault after a three-day trial and three hours of deliberation, the Travis County District Attorney&apos;s office said on March 28. The next day, he was missing during his court proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had requested that Vo be detained after the guilty verdict, but the request was denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When a defendant knows that they are likely facing a significant amount of prison time, our concern is that the risk is heightened, that they may be a flight risk. That is why we requested that this defendant be remanded into custody,&quot; Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/connecticut-man-pleads-guilty-attempted-sexual-assault-muslim-state-representative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CONNECTICUT MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ASSAULT OF MUSLIM STATE REPRESENTATIVE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vo&apos;s punishment was assessed by a jury at 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Bob Perkins presided over the case and told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fox7austin.com/news/sexual-assault-conviction-failure-to-appear-hai-vo-travis-county-texas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;FOX Austin&lt;/a&gt; that Vo was present for all his previous court appearances, and there wasn&apos;t any indication that he wouldn&apos;t show up for his sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vo was convicted of sexually assaulting a 24-year-old disabled woman. Authorities got involved when the victim told her mother that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;she was violated&lt;/a&gt; by someone she knew from church following a Lunar New Year event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family was at the church event in January 2020, and she stayed behind to watch the end of the festivities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vo offered to take her home and took her to his house where he took photos of her, an affidavit said. He then touched her inappropriately while she was changing clothes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sexually assaulted&lt;/a&gt; her, authorities said. Vo told investigators he encouraged her to change outfits but denied the assault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To the family, I am so sorry that the family has to continue to wait for justice in this case. We&apos;re really grateful to them and to their cooperation that allowed us to secure this verdict. We&apos;re also incredibly grateful to our law enforcement partners, who helped us secure this outcome,&quot; Garza said. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Elizabeth Hurley revealed she never seriously thought about having children with Hugh Grant while they were together, and sh&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;kind of&amp;quot; surprised he has five kids.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elizabeth-hurley-credits-ageless-beauty-years-makeup-chair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Hurley&lt;/a&gt; is opening up about her relationship with Hugh Grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent interview on Andy Cohen&apos;s SiriusXM radio show, &quot;Radio Andy,&quot; Hurley spoke about whether she considered having children with Grant during their 13-year relationship. When asked by Cohen, Hurley quickly answered &quot;never,&quot; without hesitation, adding it&apos;s not something she regrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know, you&apos;d think all that, but of course, had that happened, I wouldn&apos;t have baby [Damian], so you could never regret anything,&quot; Hurley explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Grant began dating in 1987 after meeting on the set of &quot;Rowing with the Wind.&quot; They withstood a cheating scandal and Grant&apos;s arrest for soliciting a sex worker in 1995, before breaking up in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/hugh-grant-reveals-why-cheated-elizabeth-hurley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;HUGH GRANT REVEALS WHY HE CHEATED ON ELIZABETH HURLEY: &apos;I WAS NOT IN A GOOD FRAME OF MIND&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she says the two never seriously discussed having children together, Hurley did share that they would often &quot;bicker&quot; about hypothetical children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, we used to think about it because we used to fight all day. We used to look in the mirror next to each other and say, &apos;It would have to be my eyes.&apos; &apos;No, my eyes.&apos; &apos;Your hair?&apos; &apos;No, my hair. I&apos;ve got a much better mouth,&apos;&quot; she said. &quot;So, we used to bicker for hours about who would look like who and, of course, none of his children look like him as it happened.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Austin Powers&quot; actress had her son Damien, now 22, in 2002, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elizabeth-hurley-confirms-death-ex-steve-bing-tribute&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;American businessman Steve Bing&lt;/a&gt;, who died by suicide in June 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant has five children — Tabitha Xiao Xi, 12, and Felix Chang, 11, with actress Tinglan Hong, and John Mungo, 11, an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son with current wife Anna Eberstein. Looking at where their lives wound up, Hurley told Cohen she is &quot;kind of&quot; surprised Grant had five kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

He&apos;s a very good dad,&quot; she said. &quot;He has five children that worship him. They adore him. They sit on Daddy&apos;s knee and all that stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurley was on the radio show alongside her son to promote their upcoming film, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elizabeth-hurley-stars-erotic-thriller-written-directed-by-son&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Strictly Confidential&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; which is also his directorial debut. The movie follows a young woman as she travels back to the Caribbean to find the truth about her best friend&apos;s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother-son duo created some controversy when it was revealed her son directed her in a sex scene. Both mother and son said it wasn&apos;t that big a deal, with Hurley telling Access Hollywood the experience was &quot;kind of liberating.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s just, it&apos;s relaxing knowing someone&apos;s behind the camera who looks out for you, which was the same on this movie in a way, because you know the things that his script needed me to do in this weren&apos;t necessarily things I had always done in movies many times before. But having him there meant that I felt safe and looked after.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I knew that in production, in the post, I knew he would look after me. So, actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elizabeth-hurley-felt-safe-filming-sex-scenes-directed-son-kind-of-liberating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;it&apos;s kind of liberating&lt;/a&gt; to work with your family. I may do it again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>US Army Corps of Engineers plans to reopen Port of Baltimore by end of April after Key Bridge collapse</title>
                    
                    <description>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it hopes to open a limited access channel to the Port of Baltimore by the end of April. It hopes to restore the full channel by the end of May.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) announced a tentative timeline to open a limited access channel that would restore safe navigation in and out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/trapped-vessels-navigate-port-of-baltimore-after-bridge-collapse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Port of Baltimore&lt;/a&gt; after the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed, blocking the vital waterway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/army&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The USACE said it plans to open&lt;/a&gt; a 280-foot-wide and 35-foot-deep channel by the end of April. The channel would provide one-way traffic in and out of the Port of Baltimore for barge container service and some vessels that move cars and farm equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USACE also said it is working to reopen the full channel, 700-foot-wide by 50-foot-deep, by the end of May to restore port access to normal capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thanks to the exhaustive work of the Unified Command during the last two weeks, including underwater surveys and detailed structural analysis of the wreckage, we’ve developed a better understanding of the immense and complex work that lies ahead,&quot; said Lt. Gen. Scott A. Spellmon, USACE commanding general said in a press release. &quot;A fully opened federal channel remains our primary goal, and we will carry out this work with care and precision, with safety as our chief priority.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-bridge-collapse-man-who-crossed-moments-before-disaster-says-im-really-lucky&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE: MAN WHO CROSSED MOMENTS BEFORE DISASTER SAYS ‘I’M REALLY LUCKY&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lt. Gen. Spellmon warned the timeline is &quot;ambitious,&quot; and things like bad weather or changes in the complexity of the wreckage could prolong the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the USACE is also working diligently to locate and recover &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/us-baltimore-bridge-collapse-mass-casualty-event-03-26-2024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the two victims still missing&lt;/a&gt; in the wreckage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349896677112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARGO SHIP IN BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSE INVOLVED IN 2016 ACCIDENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six members of a construction crew that was filling potholes on the bridge were killed when it collapsed around 1:30 a.m. on March 26. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6349890517112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Dali, a massive cargo ship,&lt;/a&gt; slammed into a support column on the Key Bridge, causing it to collapse into the Patapsco River almost instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police were able to stop traffic from entering the bridge just moments before the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the bridge collapse, the Port of Baltimore contributed about $15 million in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic activity every day.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The port is the busiest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for car shipments, handling more than 750,000 vehicles in 2023, according to data from the Maryland Port Administration.
