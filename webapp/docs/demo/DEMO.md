# 4 Demos

## CLI + Rails Console

All demos can be played from the folder `docs/demo` in this way:

üíª Command line:

```
cd webapp/ # Go into rails folder
rails c  # opens console
```

Code: within üöäüíª Rails Console:  https://github.com/palladius/gemini-news-crawler/blob/main/webapp/docs/demo/demo0X-rails-console.rb (with X=1,2,3,4)

You can also invoke them with `make demo01` .. `make demo04`.

**Note**. The most complex demo (`demo04`) is worth playing from CLI in non-deterministic way. You don't necessarily want to save the first article, and you might have a full conversation with the agent. Unfortunately I didn't have time to make this in responsive and sleek javascript, so the best experience is from `rails console`.

# Demo 1 - Article / Embeddings

![Demo 1: embeddings and neighbour gem](https://github.com/palladius/gemini-news-crawler/blob/main/webapp/app/assets/images/demo/demo1.png?raw=true "Demo 1: Embeddings")



UI: https://gemini-news-crawler-dev-x42ijqglgq-ew.a.run.app/articles/10350?easter_egg=bingo (note: article ID might change)

In this demo we want to demonstrate the ability for Ruby on Rails + PostgreS to easily host.

Lesson learnt: embeddings are BIG, and they slow significantly ActiveRecord retrievals.
Once you marry one embedding (I have 3 per article, 768 integers for each), you need to learn how to selectively `SELECT(:field1, :field2)` for the queries you do. For articles, that brought my time from 6 seconds to 50ms. üò±

# Demo 3: NewsRetriever from LangchainRB.

This works a lot better in UI, since it has images.

Some samples on CLI:

# Conclusions

![A demo cant be considered complete without a Tarantino meme](https://github.com/palladius/gemini-news-crawler/blob/main/webapp/app/assets/images/thats-a-bingo.gif?raw=true "Ooh thats a bingo!")
